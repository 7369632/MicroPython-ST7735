# MicroPython-ST7735

This is a modified version of [GuyCarver's ST7735.py](https://github.com/GuyCarver/MicroPython/blob/master/Lib/ST7735.py).

This version is for micropython-esp32.

You need a font file (some font files are in [GuyCarver's repo](https://github.com/GuyCarver/MicroPython/tree/master/Lib)).

Text nowrap option added(default: nowrap=False).

graphicstest.py is a sample code. I wrote this to make it similar to [Adafruit's graphicstest sketch for Arduino](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library/tree/master/examples/graphicstest).
